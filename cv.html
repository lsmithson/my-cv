<b>EMPLOYMENT HISTORY</b><br>
<b>Open Network Solutions Ltd (own limited company), London,
1994-present</b>:
Senior contract roles on a number of Unix, Linux and Windows Python/C/C++
development projects. I also developed a number of Open Source
Software projects, the most significant of which was
<a href="http://packages.python.org/pymqi">pyMQI</A>, a Python interface
to IBM's WebSphere MQ/MQSeries middleware.
<p>
Projects and clients have included:

<p><i>September 2010-Jan 2012, <a href="http://www.imagination.com/">Imagination</a>, London</i>.
Architect, develop and deploy software for interactive experiential exhibition
pieces for a digital agency. These included an animated 3d model and
supporting infrastructure for the inauguration of Shell's
<a href="http://www.shell.com/home/content/aboutshell/our_strategy/major_projects_2/pearl/">Pearl GTL plant</a>
in Qatar, and an automated multi-media capture, management and
upload system for Ford's exhibit at the
<a http href="https://www.blueovalcard.com/naias/">NAIAS</a> in Detroit.
All software was written in Python and used TCP & UDP networking,
Twisted, event driven asynchronous programming techniques, libgphoto2,
gstreamer and Django. The projects ran on Ubuntu Linux an MAC OS
X. Software development was supported by git, Jenkins & Jira.
<br>
My work resulted in the successful deployment & execution of stable and
high quality award winning exhibitions.

<p><i>July 2010-July 2011, JPMorgan Chase, London</i>.
While at JPMorgan Chase I worked on two separate Python development projects:
<br/>
The first was a proof of concept system evaluating the replacement of
the current Java/Sybase equities & derivatives trade booking
system. Technologies used included Python, Jython, Java,
<a href="http://www.objectivity.com">Objectivity</a> object database,
Sybase, Twisted, metaclass programing, HTTP & TCP/IP networking. I designed
and developed various parts of the infrastructure to enable the data
model, high-throughput transaction processing and interoperation with
existing systems. Notable was the development of a bespoke ORM, using
metaclass techniques to implement a declarative pattern. The projects
were written mainly in Python/Jython and ran on Windows and Redhat
Linux.
</br>
The second project was for the FX business, to replace an existing
mainframe risk management system using the bank's Python based Athena
platform. I developed up-stream feeds for STP of trades to the
backend. This used Python, IBM Websphere MQ, XML and xpath. I
co-ordinated with several teams in different timezones to successfully
put the feeds into production.


<p><i>May-June 2010, <a href="http://www.texceltechnology.com">Texcel Technology PLC</a>, Kent.</i>
Enhancements, testing and bug fixing of an embedded logging
application written in Python. I was brought in on a short term basis
to troubleshoot and complete the project at a critical time. I added
new features, fixed long standing bugs and made several performance
enhancements to the code. My work resulted in project completion and
the product successfully entering customer acceptance testing. The
project was written in Python and ran on custom hardware using
embedded WinCE.

<p> <i>February 2009 - January 2010, Defuturo Ltd, Remote/Home based</i>.

<a href="http://www.eyespy247.com">www.eyespy247.com</a>.  This was a
sophisticated Web 2.0 style site that provided on-line services for
owners of IP webcam cameras for security monitoring of homes and
businesses over the Internet. It allowed users to automatically
upload, view, share and manage images and videos captured by their IP
cameras, and to receive motion activated alert email/SMS messages. It
included a Satchmo e-commerce shop with a PayPal interface. The site
was written in Python and used Django, Satchmo, Javascript, jQuery,
AJAX, Apache, MySQL, mod_wsgi, SMTP, postfix and ffmpeg. The system
was developed on Redhat FC10 and deployed on CentOS 5. I was
responsible for the architecture, back-end design, implementation, and
the support of the live site. I was the technical lead of a
distributed team of four.

href="http://www.galacoral.co.uk">Gala Coral Group</a>, Surrey</i>.
Development of client software for a gaming system for the Chinese and
other international markets. This was a fully internationalized and
localized standalone closed kiosk system with a display, touchscreen
and scanner. The software ran on CentOS Linux and was written in
Python, using PyGTK, Glade, TCP/IP sockets and XML. The design used
the MVC pattern.  I contributed a significant part of the design,
implementation, documentation and testing of the product.

<p> <i>September 2007 - July 2008, <a
href="http://www.aems.net">AEMS</a>, London</i>.  Development of a
test framework, infrastructure and tool set for the CONNECT trading
platform. This enabled the automation of complex integration tests
featuring highly asynchronous message handling as part of AEMS's
development and QA process. I contributed to the development and
optimisation of significant parts of the framework and tools. These
were written in Python, and included a number of bespoke C/C++ Python
extensions and SWIG modules that interfaced to various parts of the
system. Python TCP/IP network and systems level programming were used
extensively throughout, as was an SQLAlchemy Oracle 10 database
interface and PyGTK/glade. Metaclass programming techniques were also
used. The tool set allowed developers to rapidly prototype and
troubleshoot their projects. All software was developed and ran on
Redhat Enterprise Linux EL3.

<p> <i>June-July 2007, <a href="http://www.visto.com">Visto
Corporation</a>, London</i>. Modifications to a dynamic content web
server. The web server was used to to generate internationalization
flexkits for embedded mobile 'phone applications and servers. It used
Apache, mod_python, Python, MySQL, Javascript, HTML/DHTML/AJAX and ran
on Windows/XP. My work resulted in the timely completion and
successful deployment of the web server.

<p> <i>October 2006 - May 2007, <a href="http://www.halcyonsoftware.com">Halcyon Software</a>, Remote/Home based</i>.
Development of a system monitoring agent
application that runs on Linux and AIX. This was a component of
Halcyon's Enterprise Management product, which monitors server
performance and resource usage, raising various alarms for abnormal
conditions. The software was written in Python, making extensive use
of XML, TCP/IP sockets, threads, system programming interfaces, RPM
packaging and PyUnit. The application was fully localized and
internationalized (i8n/l8n).

<p> <i>April-September 2006, <a href="http://www.cybview.com/">Cyberview Technology Ltd</a>,
London</i>.  Designed and developed prototype control software for a
network of distributed gaming machines. This allowed a large estate of
gaming devices to be centrally monitored and managed. The prototype
was written in Python and ran Linux Redhat Fedora Core 5 embedded on
custom hardware. It used serial line RS-232 COMMA6 protocols, UDP,
TCP, HTTP and threads. It also incorporated several security features
such as DES3 and IPSEC. I also developed a Linux USB user-space device
driver for a bespoke high-speed ticket printer.

<p> <i>February 2006, <a href="http://www.pirc.co.uk">PIRC</a>, London</i>.
